# Possible follow-up analyses { background-color="`r clrs[4]`"}

:::{ .notes}
30 minutes, really stress meant at population level.

<!--
## Plan { background-color="`r clrs_lt[4]`"}


- Simple stratification by age, sex, and other covariates of interest.

- what NOT to do: changes in TSI by year of infection

- How I personally used them for the MM paper.

- mention Hinch's work on Generation intervals.

## Prevalence of recent infections {.smaller}

::: {.notes}
one of the principal objectives of HIV-phyloTSI  is to estimate incidence, by
estimating the proportion of infection that are recent.
:::

:::: { .columns }

::: { .column  width=60%}
Following @freeman_prevalence_1980 and @brookmeyer_estimation_1995, if incidence is constant, it can be estimated as:

$$
  I = \frac{\text{# recent}}{\text{# uninfected} \times MDRI }
$$
:::



::: { .column width=40%}
![](figures/mdri.png){fig-align="center" layout-valign="center}
:::

::::

where $MDRI$ = mean duration of recency of infection.

- $MDRI = P[\text{ever being classified as recent}] \times E[ TSI | \text{classified as recent} ]$ 
- **not a constant**: viral suppression, underlying population.

Here we **focus on the numerator**.

## Simulation study: {.smaller}

::: {.notes}
Blue: true recents
Orange: estimated recents
Green: false recents: ie estimated recents but chronic
bar at 2%
:::

In simulated settings, the prevalence of recent infections is well estimated,
despite at least 2% of recent classifications are wrong.

## Application in Zambia {.smaller}

When directly applied to real-world data, HIV-phyloTSI generally produces smaller TSI  
for known recent infections as compared to people with unknown first positive date:

## Suggestions on TSI comparison among groups {.smaller}

::: {.notes}
-> Do not use means, as distribution is skewed (need to square results...) 
:::

Comparing simple summary statistics can be misleading: 

- need to make sure statistic is *reliable*
- need to *chose* summary statistic: [**median**]{.fragment}

For reliability:

1. make sure groups are large enough (*minimum of 40 per group*)
2. Perform **bootstrap** to estimate uncertainty around  

## Suggestions on TSI comparison:  bootstrap {.smaller}

::: {.notes}
read then mention what the equivalent would be for this scenario
:::

Bootstrapping: statistical technique which *recycles* analysis data to estimate
uncertainty around an estimator (e.g. median).

1. **Synthetic data** sets of the same size are obtained by sampling with replacement from the data.
2. The **estimator is computed** on each synthetic data set.
3. The distribution of the estimators obtained on the syntetic data sets is summarised through 95% quantiles.

## Results on sample dataset:

::: {.notes}
Small sample sizes, but worth it to illustrate: 1. algorithm, and 2. uncertainty around medians.

## How **NOT** to perform grouping:

::: {.notes}
explain why:
1. of course, if we chose only individuals with HIV-phyloTSI < 1, there is 0 probability of using ... 
2. If we have cross-sectional data, the only infections that are estimated to be from 5-10 years ago will be chronic infection. We are not able to observe recent infections from that period, 
implying we should not compare this different time periods.
3. more of a personal heuristic suggestion, 
::: 

Groups should be made based on covariates different than HIV-phyloTSI inputs or outputs.

Do NOT:

1. Group by estimate of HIV-phyloTSI 
2. Group by estimated date of infection 
3. Again: chose groups of sizes < 40

To account for individual level uncertainty, these studies not only make use of
central estimates, but also the output prediction/uncertainty range

::: {.notes}
Note that although here it seems we are performing analyses at the individual 
level, the analyses are then performed by age groups and gender by performing
some fancy smoothing: we do not need each pair to be 100% sure.

## Summing up {.smaller}

::: {.notes}
Unanswered questions: generation intervals
:::

- HIV-phyloTSI is a novel algorithm to estimate infection dates.

- alternative to serological assays which allows more control on definition of recency
  (Robust to subtype and ART usage)

- preliminary analyses and simulation studies demonstrate good performances at population level

- but may be inaccurate at the individual level: very large prediction intervals.

- Can help us explore answers to unanswered questions
