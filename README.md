# HIV-phyloTSI-workshops
Materials for HIV-phyloTSI training workshops in Nairobi and Gaborone.

The repository is structured as follows:
- *data*: example inputs needed to run HIV-phyloTSI and outputs of the analyses.
- *slides*: directory containing all materials needed to produce the workshop slides.
- *src*: scripts used to run the HIV-phyloTSI analyses and process the outputs. Specifically:
    - `workshop_analyses.R` contains the R code that will be run during the workshop.
    - the `pipeline` directory contains the R scripts that drive the entire phylogenetic pipeline

## Prerequisites

To run the analyses, it is best to be on Linux Operating System or Mac OS.
It is possible to "simulate" such an environment on Windows, through WSL [tutorial](https://discourse.ubuntu.com/t/install-ubuntu-on-wsl2-on-windows-10/26269).
To follow instructions line by line, conda or miniconda should be installed.

## Running HIV-phyloTSI

Instructions to run the workshop materials can be found in the slides at: 
- `slides/index.pdf`
- or `slides/section3-practical.qmd`
