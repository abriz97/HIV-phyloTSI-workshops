## Prerequisites

To run the analyses, it is best to be on a Linux environment. 
It is possible to "simulate" such an environment on Windows, through WSL [tutorial](https://discourse.ubuntu.com/t/install-ubuntu-on-wsl2-on-windows-10/26269).
Once this is set up, it is possible to install the software required following the instructions [here](TODO), assuming R is installed.
In particular, the following pieces of software will be downloaded/installed:
- [phyloscanner](https://github.com/BDI-pathogens/phyloscanner)
- IQTREE
